# Cesar Challenge

### Running algorithm questions

You can run the algorithm questions by using these commands in terminal:

```sh
$ g++ x.cpp
$ ./a.out < x.in
```

where x is the number of the question.

The space and time complexity is in the beginning of each code.

### Running question four

Just run and type the terms of your search in the search box

### Running question six

There are two apps: the caller and the service (doens't have activities). You have to run both before testing.
